In this repository I have added java programs to test a JUnitTesting file with positive and negative test cases for
mathematical operations like divide and square and also character count. We implement Unit Testing in Java Programming
language with the help of Eclipse IDE and try to test the code with some positive and negative test cases.
Note: You must have all the .java files setup in the same package of JUnitTest and then run each of them to get the
respective test results in the console window. Correctly import the porject into your IDE or Java machine.
